Version 1.6.2 (1 is the game, 6 is the version, 2 is the revision)

Game designed and developed by Leonardo! (15 years old as of 3/8/25) with extensive help from ChatGPT3.5 and Copilot
Most of the programming and debugging was done by me, Leonardo, but explanations of various functions and correction of certain errors were done by ChatGPT3.5
Game not for mass publication, but to learn to program in Python Game useful for building a programming portfolio (for me), learning Python, and having fun.
To play use the arrow keys or WASD to move, left mouse button to rotate the sword
most of the pixel art in the game created by me (except for the wall designs, they are available for free at craftpix.net), ideas created by me, key design inspired by Super Mario World, colors and border are not identical but the shape is the same, DON'T use my pixel art as your own.
To use the game, it is recommended to have Python 3.13 or higher installed.
To operate the files open the terminal or powershell (preferably cmd), navigate to the folder where the game is installed and type "python main.py" (without quotes) to start the game, if it doesn't work try "python3 main.py" or "py main.py"


GAME IN DEVELOPMENT, NOT ALL FEATURES ARE IMPLEMENTED!!
